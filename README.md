# E-LEARNING PLATFORM UI

**E-Learning Platform UI** is a modern, interactive, and responsive frontend design for an online learning platform.

The project is designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with dynamic features powered by **JSON data** and **localStorage** for progress tracking.

This UI is perfect for anyone looking to build a polished, professional online course website or prototype for an educational platform.
